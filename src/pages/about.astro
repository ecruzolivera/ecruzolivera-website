    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I'm a Developer with 10+ years of experience designing and implementing software for Embedded Systems.</p>
    <p>
      Colleagues know me as a highly creative engineer who can always be trusted to come up with a new approach. I spend
      a lot of time understanding the project requirements before start designing the solution. I can (and often do)
      work well alone, but Iâ€™m at my best collaborating with others.
    </p>
    <p>
      My areas of interest are not only restricted to Embedded Systems, it also cover the fields of Digital Signal
      Processing and Web Development. You can read my thoughts in my <a href="/"> blog </a>.
