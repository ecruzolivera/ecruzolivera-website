          I'm a Developer with 7 years of experience designing and implementing
          software for Embedded Systems.

          Colleagues know me as a highly creative engineer who can always be
          trusted to come up with a new approach. I spend a lot of time
          understanding the project requirements before start designing the
          solution. I can (and often do) work well alone, but Iâ€™m at my best
          collaborating with others.

          My areas of interest are not only restricted to Embedded Systems, it
          also cover the fields of Digital Signal Processing and Web
          Development. You can read my thoughts in my{' '}
