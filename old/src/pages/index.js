          About Me
        </h1>
        <p>
          I'm a Developer with 10+ years of experience designing and
          implementing software for Embedded Systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Colleagues know me as a highly creative engineer who can always be
          trusted to come up with a new approach. I spend a lot of time
          understanding the project requirements before start designing the
          solution. I can (and often do) work well alone, but Iâ€™m at my best
          collaborating with others.
        </p>
        <p>
          My areas of interest are not only restricted to Embedded Systems, it
          also cover the fields of Digital Signal Processing and Web
          Development. You can read my thoughts in my{" "}
